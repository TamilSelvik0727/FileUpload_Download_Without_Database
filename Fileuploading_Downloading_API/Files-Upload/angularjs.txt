What is
		# a client side js framework.
		# executed only by the browser.




AngularJs

	# Rich Internet Application.
	# Single Page Application.
	# MVC Pattern.
	# Cross Browswer Compatability.
	# Open Source & Free
	
	
Disadvantages

	# No security for source
	# JavaScript must be enabled to work.
	
	
Concepts/Module


	# Databinding
		
		Two Way Data Binding
		
			# keeps the model and view in sync at all the times.
			# a change in the model updates the view.
			# a change in view updates the model.
			
			# Binding expression updates the view when the model changes-{{message}}
			# Binding expression updates the model when the view changes  ng-model
			
			
			ng-model
			
				->input
				->select
				->textarea
	# Providers
	# Validators
	# Directives
	
			# Extends the HTML  element attributes.
			# Mostly start with ng-
			# Contains Many Built-in directives.
			# Able to create and customize directives
			# also start with x-,data-,:,_.
			
			
			
		BuiltIn Directives
			
			ng-app 	    -> start to angular application.<html><body><div>(bootsraped application)
			ng-init	    -> to initalize the values,string. like expression.
			ng-model    -> Use to 2Way data binding,
			ng-bind     -> thrugh ng-bind also can display the expression value in html control.<span >
			ng-repeat   -> mostly used in arrays, or collection of elements
			ng-readOnly -> cannot edit the element ,can read only.
			ng-disabled -> can fix the htlm element.also based on the expression result.
			ng-if       -> to take the element or Recreate it based on the expression.
			
		
	# Controllers
			
			# It is  a JavaScript object.
			# Contains properties and functions.
			# Application data's are controlled by controlers
			# The job of the controller is to build a model for the view to display.
			# $scope is used as a parameter ,refers the module controlled by the controller.
			# ng-controller directive is used.
			# Controllers can be stored as a external files.
			# can define many controllers
			
			var myController = function ($scope){
			$scope.message="Angular js";}
	# Model
	
			# One of the component of mvc Architecture.
			# Managing the data used in application.
			# Used to Handle user interactions such as clicking.
			# $scope object is used by the model, which contain data and fucntions.
			# ng-model is used for data binding.connecting model in view.
	
	
	# Modules
	
			
			# Angular js identified the file where the module created.
			# container for different parts of application.
			# Used to define 
				-> functionalities
				-> add controllers
				-> filters
				-> services
				-> directives to the applications.
			# Easy to reduce the code in different applications.
			# Module is attached to the controller to define the logical boundary for the controller.
			# It is easily testable and maintanable component.
			# Used to organize application easily.
			
		Module Types.
		
			# Application module
					# ng-app used to speficy the module.
			
				<script>
				var mod=angular.module("sample",[]); []-it does not dependent .
				mod.servive('service name',function)
				mod.factory('factory name',function)
				mod.provider('provider name',function)
				</scrcipt>
				
				
			# Controller module
				<script>
					var mod=angular.module("sample",[]);
					mod.controller('controller name',function)</script>
					-> ng-controller is used to speficy.
				
			
			
			
	# Expression
			
			# Angular js evaluates expression and bind the result with HTML similar to javascript.
			# Contains Literals,Operators,Variables.
			# {{Expression}}, ng-bind=expressoin.
			# Numbers,Strings,Objects,Arrays,are used.
			# ng-app,ng-app =""attribute is must to know angularjs,<body><div>
			# ng-init --->Used to initialize the variables.
			
	AngularJs vs Js Expressions
	
		-> Cannot contain loops,conditions,exceptions 
			ex-while loop,for loop,if else.
			
		-> Cannot contain functions
		
		-> Cannot contain comma
		
	SOrting Data in Angular Js
		
		
		#  Useorder By Filter
			-> {{orderBy_expression | orderBy : expression : reverse}}
			-> Example:ng-repeat="employee in employees | orderby:'salary':false"
			
		# To sort in ascending order,set reverse to false.
		# To sort in descending order,set reverse to true.
		# also use + and - to sort in ascending and descending order respectively.
			-> Example:ng-repeat="employee in employees | orderby:'+salary'"
		
		
		
	# Factories
	# Services
	# Filters
	
		# Filters can do three different things.
			-> Format
			-> Sort
			->Filter data
			
		# Filters can be used with the binding expression or a directive.
		# To Apply using pipe(|) character
		
			{{expression | filterName:parameter}}
	# Dependency Injection
	# Scope
	
		# Scope is an Build in object.
		# It contains data and fucntion.
		# Used to bind view (HTML)part /and controller part(JavaScript)
		# View can display $scope data using an expression ,
		# ng-model,ng-bind directive.
		
	ScopeTypes
		# $rootScope
			-> Global(parent for all the scope object)
			-> given in ng-app directive.
			-> and avilability of data is in the full application.
		# $scope
			-> childObject 
			-> local to that HTML Element.
