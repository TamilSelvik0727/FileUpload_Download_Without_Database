Service-Oriented Architecture
	
	# Refer 1.1.1
	# SOA Provides an Enterprise Architecture.
	# That supports building connected enterprise application to provide solutions to business problems.
	# SOA facilitates the development of enterprise applications.
	# As modular business webservices that can be 
	
			# Easily Integrated
			# Reused
			# Creating a truly flexible
			# Adaptable IT Inffrastructure.
			
SERVICES

	# SOA Seperates business function into distinct units,or services.
	
	# SOA Application reuses services to automate a business process.
	
	# A standard interface and message structure define services.
	
	# The Most widely used mechanism are Webservices.
	
	# These standard include the WSDL-Webservice Description Language.
	   file for service interface definition .
	   
	# XML Schema Documents (XSD) for message structure defenition.
	
	# XML Standards are easily exchanged using standard protocol.
	
	# When designing a SOA approach, you create a service portfolio plan to identify
	  common functionality to use as a service within the business process. 
	  
	# By Creating and maintaining a plan ,you ensure that existing services and applications are reused
	  ,or repurpose when ever possible.
	  
	# Also reduces the time spent in creating needed functionality for the application
	
	
ORACLE SOA SUITE
	
	# Oracle soa suite provides  a complete set of service infrastructure components for
		
			->Designing
			->Deploying
			->Managing composite application.
			
	# It enables services to be 
	
		->created,
		->managed,
		->Orchestra into composite applications and 
		business process.
		
	# Composite enable you to easily assemble multiple technology components into one SOA composite applications.
	
	# It plugs into hetrogeneous IT Infrastructure and enables enterprise to incrementally adopt SOA.
	
	# The components of Oracle Suite is benefit from Common capabilities,
	
		-> Single deployment
		-> Management
		-> Tooling model
		-> end-to-end security
		-> unifield metadata management.
		
	# It is unique in that provides set of integrated capabilities.
	
		# Messaging
		# Service discovery
		# Orchestration
		# Web services management and security.
		# Business rules
		# Human Integration
		# Events framework
		# Business activity monitoring.
		
		
		
Standards Used by Oracle SOA Suite to Enable SOA
	
	# Oracle soa suite puts a strong emphasis on standars and interoperability.
		
	# Service Component Architecture (SCA) assembly model.
	
			# Provides the service details and their interdependencies to forfm composite applications
			
			# SCA enables you to represent business logic as reusable service components 
			
				-> that can be easily integrated into any SCA-compliant application.
				
			# The specification fro the SCA Standard is maintained by the 
			
				->(OASIS) Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards through the open
				->(CSA) Composite Services Architecture Member section.
	
	# Service Data Objects(SDO)
	
			# It specifies a standard data method and can be mokdify business data regardless of how it is physically accessed
			
			# Knowledge is not required about how to access a particular back-end data souce to use SDO in a SOA composite application
		
			# Consequently ,you can use static or dynamic programming styles and obtain connected and disconnected access.
			
			
BPEL-Business Process Execution Language

	# Provides enterprise with an industry standard fro business-process orchestration and execution.
	
	# Using BPEL ,you design a business process that integrates a series of discrete services into an end to end process flow.
	
	# This integration reduces process cost and complexity.
	
	# Bpel version 1.1 and 2.0 are supported.
	
	
XSL Transformation (XSLT)

	# rocess XML documents and transforms document data from one XML Schema to another.
	
XQuery Transformation (XQuery)

	# Queries and transforms collections of structured and unstructured data ,typically in the form of XML.
		 
Java Connector Architecture(JCA)

	# Provides a java technology solutions to the problem of connectivity between the many applications servers in Enterprise Information System(EIS)
	
Java Messaging Service(JMS)

	# Provides a messaging standard that allows application components based on the
	  Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to access business logic distributed
	  among heterogeneous systems.
	  
	  
Web Service Defenition Language(WSDL) file

	# Provides the entry point to SOA Application.
	# WSDL provides  a standard contract language.
	# central of understanding the capabilities of a service.
	
	
Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP)

	# Provides default network protocol for message delivery.
	
Representational state protocol(REST)

	# It provides an architecture for designing network applications.
	# RESTful application use HTTP request to post data
	
		->CREATE
		->UPDATE
		->GET DATA(make queries)
		->DELETE
		
	#REST provides an alternative to using webservice.
	
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

	# It provides a language for representing 
	
		->simple data structure 
		->associative arrays
		
		called objects.
		
	# Json is a standard designed for human-readable data interchange.
	
	# derived from JavaScript .
	
Web Application Description Language

	# Provides a readable XML Description of HTTP-based web applications
	(REST Web Service)
	
	# It simplifies the Reuse of webservices.
	
	# Based on the existing HTTP architecture of the web. 
	
	
	
Service Component Architecture within SOA Composite Applications

	# Orcale SOA Suite uses the SCA Standards.
	
	# as a way to assemble service components into SOA Composite application.
	
	# SCA Provides a programming model for
	
	
		->Creating service components written with wide range of technologies.
		->Including Programming languages
		
			# JAVA
			# C++
		->Declarative languages
		
			# XSLT
			
		->The use of specific progranning and technologies (Webservices) not required with SCA.
	
		-> Assembling the service components in to a SOA Composite applications.
		
		->In the SCA Environment ,service components are building blocks of application.
		
		
	# SCA Provides a model for assembling distributed groups of service components into an application
	
	# It Enabling you to describe the details of service and how services and service components interact.
	
	# Composites are used to group service components.
	
	# Wires are used to connect service components.
	
	# SCA helps to remove middle ware concerns from the programming code 
	
		->by applying infrastructure declaratively to composites, including security and transaction.
		
		
		
SCA BENEFITS


	# Loose Coupling-
	
	# Flexibility-replaced by other service components easily.
	
	# Service invocation-invoked either synchronously or asynchronously
	
	# Productivity-easily intergrated to create soa composite application.
	
	# Easy maintenance and debugging-
	
	
	
	# SOA composite is an assembly of 
		->services ,
		->service components,
		->referenes designed
		->deployed in single application.
		
	# Wiring b/w services,service,components,and references enables message communication.
	
	# The details for  a composite are stired in composite.xml file
	
	refer1.1 image
	
SERVICE COMPONENTS


	# It is building blocks
	# that you use to construct a SOA Composite application
	
	
BPEL PROCESS

	# It provides process orchestration and storage of a
	
	
			->Synchronous or
			->asynchronous process.
			
	# you design a business process that integrates a series of business activities and services into end-to-end process flow.
	
	
Business Rules

	# It enables you to design a business decision based on rules.
	
	
Human Tasks

	# It provides workflow modeling that describes the task for users or groups to perform as a part of end-to-end business process flow.
	
Mediators

	# It route events (message) between different components.
	
	
Spring

	# It enables you to integrate java interfaces into SOA composite applications.
	
	
SubProcess

	# It allows the same code to be reused within the same BPEL.
	
	

	
BINDING COMPONENTS

	# Binding components establish a connection between a SOA Composite and the external world.
		
	# 2 Types
		
	# SERVICES
		
			-> Services provides the outside world with an entry point to the SOA Composite application.
			
			-> The WSDL file of the service adverties its capabilities to external applications.
			
			-> These capabilities are used fro contacting the soa composite application components.
			
			-> The binding connectivity of the service describes the protocols that can communicate with the service.
			
			-> for example SOAP/HTTP or JCA Adapter.
			
	#REFERENCES
		
			-> References enables messages to be sent from the SOA composite application to external services in the outside world.
			
			
WIRES

	# It enables you to graphically connect the following components in a single SOA Composite application for messaging communication.
	
	
		-> Service to service components
		
		-> Service components to other Service components.
		
		-> Service components to references.
